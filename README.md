# ShelfSense

**ShelfSense** is a simple and easy-to-use mobile app that helps you manage the food items you keep at home—in your pantry, fridge, or shelves. It lets you keep track of your food, reminds you when items are about to expire, and encourages you to donate unused food to those in need.

## Getting Started

- **Add Food Button**: Tap this button at the bottom of the screen to add a new food item.
- **Expiry Status Colors**:
